## AUTO GIT
The purpose of this project is to show that the number of commits of a git repo does not mean anything,
just like the number of line / number of code a program.

Although it's still a good tool to mess up those HR/PM who don't understand the real contribution of a programmer, or people who just look for the KPI (Key Performance Indicators).
I mean, those managers would definitely love this. :)

## TODO
[ ] commit to private repo (with SSH key)
[ ] background auto commit & push
[ ] make massive changes to the file without messing up the original file
